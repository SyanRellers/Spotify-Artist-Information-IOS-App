This app's purpose is to provide the base framework for a musical artist informational app. 
It displays background information about the artist, information about their newest release, a catalog of their most popular music, and a list of their upcoming shows. 
The popular music section navigates to a song information page that displays metadata associated with each song including the name, album, duration, demo audio playback, album cover, and Spotify link. 
On the new release section, I also included links to the song's upload on Apple Music, Tidal, and Deezer, as well as Spotify.
This app can be extended in the future to interface with the Spotify API which would enable many more cool display features, such as users' top artists being displayed with all of their corresponding information.
